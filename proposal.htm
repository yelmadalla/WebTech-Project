    <h1>Project Proposal</h1>
    <hr>
    <ul>
        <h3><li>What is your website about?</li></h3>
        <p>My website will be about studying abroad and doing an 
            exchange semester at <a href="https://www.hec.edu/en" target="_blank">HEC Paris</a>. Not only will it discuss 
            the overview and background of the studying abroad process, 
            but also the experience at HEC as a whole alongside a travel
            guide of living in Paris and places to visit on a budget 
            while abroad. </p>
            <img src="Images/hecparis.jpg" width="300">
        <br>
        <h3><li>What is the objective of your website?</li></h3>
        <p>I derived this idea for a website as I was recently abroad at HEC
            Paris last semester, in the Spring 2019, and whilst being back on
            campus I've had many students ask me about my experience alongside other
            prospective students who are considering studying abroad and
            are considering the Exchange program I did. The objective of this
            website would be to allow prospective Babson students (First years to Juniors)
            to understand what this experience entails and to hopefully aid them 
            in making the right decision for them in studying abroad.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3><li>Who is your target audience?</li></h3>
        <p>The target audience for this website would definitely be tailored to 
            Babson students who are interested in learning more about this experience
            and that are potentially considering HEC Paris as one of their options.
            More specifically, it would be Sophomores and Juniors who are currently
            in the process of choosing where to study abroad or are already applying for
            the next semester.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3><li>What content do you plan to include in each page of your website?</li></h3>
        <p>For the pages of my website, I'd like to include one page with the background
            of studying abroad at Babson, what it entails and how the initial
            process actually is with the International Student Office, discussing more specifically
            HEC Paris and why it should be an option.  <br>
            The next page would be about HEC Paris and how it works, alongside tips
            and tricks for getting by, where to live, how classes are, comparisons to Babson College, 
            their offerings and value it can provide. <br>
            The third page would be a travel guide for Paris, as HEC Paris is out of the city by
            about 40 minutes to an hour, going to Paris isn't as simple and it's very dispersive.
            I want to have a nice travel guide with options of where to eat, what to go see, and how to make the 
            best of your time in Paris and its surroundings.<br>
            The fourth page would be a travel guide for the rest of Europe, cities that
            I recommend to go see during the time abroad other than in France, with some brief
            travel guides for those cities too.
